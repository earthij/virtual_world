# Virtual World

## Description
This project is a virtual world where self-driving cars will move around autonomously. The project is under development, and currently, it features a simple graph editor. Users can add nodes, select nodes, and create edges between nodes using mouse clicks. In the future, AI integration will enable the self-driving cars functionality.

## Features
- Add nodes: Single click on the canvas to add a node.
- Select nodes: Click on an existing node to select it.
- Create edges: If a node is already selected, clicking another node creates an edge between the two nodes.

## Installation
There are no special installation instructions. Simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/earthij/virtual_world.git
cd virtual_world
```

## Usage
- **Add a Node**: Single click on the black canvas area.
- **Select a Node**: Click on an existing node to select it.
- **Create an Edge**: If a node is already selected, click another node to create an edge between the two nodes.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Core scripting language.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the graph editor.
